Stephen is a '15 at Dartmouth studying Computer Science. Fascinated by technology from a young age, he fell in love with Computer Science after taking Dartmouth's Introductory CS course, Computer Science 1, taught by Professor Cormen. Since then, he has built his CS knowledge and become particularly interested in learning the ins and outs of Web Development and learning to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence. Outside of the classroom, Stephen is an avid mountain biker, the former president and current advisor for a campus political group, and the Vice President of Alpha Chi Alpha Fraternity.

Stephen spent the Winter term working at Urban Compass, a start-up in New York City focused on fixing the broken New York City real estate market. There, he learned valuable skills that he hopes to apply to his work in the DALI lab this term.

In the DALI lab, Stephen is the Lead Developer on the Arctic Virtual Forum project, which aims to build an information hub and discussion forum for members of the Arctic academic community or people simply interested in the Arctic to come together, learn, and generate dialogue about the Arctic. In working on this project, Stephen has and continues to gain a better understanding of web technologies, learn the process by which a product is built from scratch to completion, and acquire valuable communication and management skills.
